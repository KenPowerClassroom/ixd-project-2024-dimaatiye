        <td> Classcraft is highly engaging for both teachers and students. 
            It transforms the classroom into an immersive gaming environment where
             students work together to achieve common goals, complete quests, and

        <td>Kahoot tracks basic progress such as correct answers and the time taken to answer questions,<br>
             providing immediate feedback during gameplay to indicate correctness.<br> However,
              it doesn't offer extensive feedback beyond this immediate response or personalized<br>
               recommendations to aid in performance improvement. <br>While teachers can utilize the
                data collected during Kahoot sessions to identify areas for further support,<br>
                 the platform itself doesn't prioritize personalized learning experiences.<br>
                  Instead, Kahoot is primarily focused on creating engaging and interactive learning 
            environments rather than providing in-depth progress tracking or tailored learning paths.</td>
